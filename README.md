## Usage

To use this application, you'll need to have Node.js , React.js , hashconnect and the @hashgraph/sdk and dotenv modules installed. Once you have those dependencies installed, you can clone this repository and run the back-end application using `npm run start` and 
front-application using `npm run start`.
Once these applications start running at different ports you need to go to the web page and should need to follow these steps-

1. Hit the Connect wallet button and login with predefined govt hashpack account(0.0.3885341)-> No need to register
2. Hit the Connect wallet button and login with predefined MRV hashpack account(0.0.4376836)-> No need to register
3. Hit the Connect wallet button and register the new user

#### NOTE :
This decentralized application (Dapp) has been developed specifically for proof of concept (POC) purposes. We have thoroughly tested the entire user journey using their account IDs. Looking ahead, there is potential to expand the implementation of this application on a larger scale.
